		<p> Snow is a white female stray cat that was rescued from a tree. She is a really unique cat with two different colored eyes. One yellow one blue. We named her snow due to her fur color being as white as snow. She is typically lazy and likes to sleep around, so we really recommend her if you just want a non-high priority companion.
