			<h1>Ranking of Kings</h1>
			<p>Ranking of Kings is a heartwarming anime about pure hearted prince's adventure to becoming a king, but due to being deaf he gets underestimated and made fun of by the people of his kingdom. With a great story, and a simple but good animation style, I fell in love with it. </p>
